Yii 2 usuario is a highly customizable and extensible user management, RBAC management, authentication, 
and authorization Yii2 module extension. 

It works extensively with Yii's Container making it really easy to override absolutely anything within its core. The 
module is built to work out of the box with some minor config tweaks and it comes with the following features: 
 
- Backend user/profile/account management
- Backend RBAC management 
- Login via username/email + password process
- Login via social network process
- Password recovery process
- Two-Factor authentication process 
- Google reCaptcha

We considered that RBAC was essential to be included into any user management module, even if you simply use one user 
with `admin` role, its much better to actually work with RBAC just in case your application scales in the future.

## Boostrap 4 and 5 support

With the release of 1.6, contributors started implementing changes for supporting newer versions of the Boostrap library,
being Usuario stuck at 3.

Up until around May 2023, the `master` branch will remain stable, so devs who in these years relied on it for
deployment can have time to migrate to a stable version.
BS5 development is ongoing on branch [`2.0.0-dev`](https://github.com/2amigos/yii2-usuario/tree/v2.0.0-dev),
which will eventually be merged in `master` around May.

You can check issues #476, #488, #500 for updates, or the [branch itself](https://github.com/2amigos/yii2-usuario/tree/v2.0.0-dev).

## Credits

This module is highly inspired by the excellent work of [Dektrium](https://dektrium.com/) on both of its modules: 

- [Yii 2 User](https://github.com/dektrium/yii2-user)
- [Yii 2 RBAC](https://github.com/dektrium/yii2-rbac)

In fact, we have used some of its processes, commands, views, and some of its attribute names to somehow standardize the 
modules and make it easier for our developers to swap from [Dektrium's](https://dektrium.com) modules to our own.
