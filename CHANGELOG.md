## 1.6.0 January 9, 2023

**WARNING**: this release (long time due) makes a step forward in PHP
compatibility, leaving behind obsolete versions. While yii2-usuario should
still work without issues on 5.6, from now on testing and development will
look forward and maintain only >=7.4 versions.

There's also a **security issue** for 2FA tokens: `settings/two-factor` route
wasn't checking for the currently logged in user, so any authenticated account
could access to all user's 2FA root code. If you cannot upgrade, check
[24d5d5744fe0](https://github.com/2amigos/yii2-usuario/commit/24d5d5744fe03f3173ea180f106865ffaf4f48a4).
