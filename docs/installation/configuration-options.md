    public function behaviors()
    {

#### administrators (type: `array`, default: `[]`)

simple backends with static administrators that won't change throughout time.

    'reconfirmationMailSubject' => Yii::t('usuario', 'Confirm email change on {0}', $app->name),
    'recoveryMailSubject' => Yii::t('usuario', 'Complete password reset on {0}', $app->name),
]
```

#### blowfishCost (type: `integer`, default: `10`)

Is the cost parameter used by the Blowfish hash algorithm. The higher the value of cost, the longer it takes to generate 
the hash and to verify a password against it. Higher cost therefore slows down a brute-force attack. For the best 
protected against brute-force attacks, set it to the highest value that is tolerable on production servers. The time 
taken to compute the hash doubles for every increment by one of `$blowfishCost`.
