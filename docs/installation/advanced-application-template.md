Advanced Application Template
=============================

This page is dedicated for those who prefer to use default [Advanced Application Template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced) provided by the Yii core team. Please check [their readme](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced#readme) file on why and when you should use it, for now we're going to explain on how Yii2 User Module extension could be used for the case if you prefer it.
 
 > We highly recommend you to use [Sidekit Application Template](http://www.2amigos.us/) which has sensible default packages, and everything you need to start project in no time with batteries included! ;-)
 >
 > [Check this page](sidekit-application-template.md) if you decided to use it.
 
 If you want to use the default [Basic Application Template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-basic) with our extension, then check [Basic Application Template documentation page](basic-application-template.md).
